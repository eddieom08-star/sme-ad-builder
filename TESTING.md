# Testing Documentation

## Overview

Automated tests have been implemented to ensure all campaign management functionality remains intact through future changes. The test suite covers:

1. **Campaign Wizard Store** - State management, validation, and persistence
2. **Campaigns List Component** - Rendering, delete functionality, and UI interactions
3. **Wizard Client** - Session persistence and smart reset logic
4. **Draft Workflow Integration** - Complete end-to-end draft creation, editing, and deletion

## Test Infrastructure

### Tools Used
- **Jest** - Test framework
- **React Testing Library** - Component testing
- **@testing-library/user-event** - User interaction simulation

### Configuration Files
- `jest.config.js` - Jest configuration
- `jest.setup.js` - Test environment setup

### Key Testing Principles
- Mock localStorage for isolated tests
- Test user workflows, not implementation details
- Verify critical business logic (uniqueness, validation, persistence)
- Ensure cascading operations (delete campaign + ads)

## Test Coverage

- ✅ **Prioritize edit mode over draft preservation**

**Session Persistence Scenarios** (3 tests)
- ✅ **Preserve wizard state when user navigates away and returns**
- ✅ **Start fresh when creating new campaign**
- ✅ **Handle transition from draft to launched campaign**

**Edge Cases** (3 tests)
- ✅ Handle invalid edit campaign ID
- ✅ Handle corrupted localStorage data
- ✅ Re-run effects when searchParams change

### 4. Draft Workflow Integration Tests (`__tests__/integration/draft-workflow.test.ts`)

**Create and Save** (4 tests)
- ✅ Create new draft from scratch
- ✅ **Save draft to localStorage (first save)**
- ✅ **Update existing draft without duplicates (upsert pattern)**
- ✅ **Save multiple different drafts correctly**

**Load and Edit** (3 tests)
- ✅ Load draft back into wizard
- ✅ Load draft with associated ads
- ✅ **Edit loaded draft and save without duplicating**

**Delete** (2 tests)
- ✅ Delete draft campaign
- ✅ **Cascading delete of campaign and all associated ads**

**Name Uniqueness** (3 tests)
- ✅ **Prevent duplicate campaign names when creating new draft**
- ✅ **Allow same name when editing existing draft**
- ✅ **Prevent renaming draft to existing campaign name**

**Complete Flow** (1 test)
- ✅ **End-to-end: create → save → navigate away → return → edit → delete**

## Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run tests in watch mode (for development)
npm run test:watch

# Run tests with coverage report
npm run test:coverage

# Run tests in CI mode
npm run test:ci
```

## Test Scripts

```json
{
  "test": "jest",
  "test:watch": "jest --watch",
  "test:coverage": "jest --coverage",
  "test:ci": "jest --ci --coverage --maxWorkers=2"
}
```

## Critical Features Protected by Tests

### 1. Session Persistence ✅
**Problem:** Users lost draft data when navigating away
**Tests:**
- `wizard-client.test.tsx` - "should NOT reset when draft in progress"
- `wizard-client.test.tsx` - "should preserve wizard state when user navigates away and returns"

### 2. Upsert Pattern (No Duplicates) ✅
**Problem:** Clicking "Save Draft" multiple times created duplicates
**Tests:**
- `draft-workflow.test.ts` - "should update existing draft without duplicates"
- `draft-workflow.test.ts` - "should edit loaded draft and save without duplicating"

### 3. Campaign Name Uniqueness ✅
**Problem:** Users could create campaigns with identical names
**Tests:**
- `wizard-store.test.ts` - "should detect duplicate campaign names"
- `draft-workflow.test.ts` - "should prevent duplicate campaign names when creating new draft"
- `draft-workflow.test.ts` - "should allow same name when editing existing draft"

### 4. Cascading Deletes ✅
**Problem:** Deleting campaign left orphaned ads
**Tests:**
- `campaigns-list-client.test.tsx` - "should delete associated ads when campaign is deleted"
- `draft-workflow.test.ts` - "should delete campaign and all associated ads"

### 5. Smart Reset Logic ✅
**Problem:** Reset was called too aggressively, wiping preserved data
**Tests:**
- `wizard-client.test.tsx` - "should reset wizard when starting fresh"
- `wizard-client.test.tsx` - "should NOT reset when draft in progress"

## Test Execution Status

The testing infrastructure is fully configured and operational. Tests are designed to:

1. **Prevent Regressions** - Catch bugs before they reach production
2. **Document Behavior** - Tests serve as living documentation
3. **Enable Refactoring** - Change code confidently knowing tests will catch breaks
4. **Ensure Data Integrity** - Verify critical operations like upsert, delete, uniqueness

## Future Enhancements

1. **E2E Tests with Playwright** - Test full user journeys in browser
2. **Visual Regression Tests** - Catch UI changes
3. **Performance Tests** - Monitor render times and bundle size
4. **API Integration Tests** - Test with mock API responses
5. **Accessibility Tests** - Ensure WCAG compliance

## Debugging Tests

```bash
# Run specific test file
npm test wizard-store.test

# Run specific test by name
npm test -- -t "should prevent duplicate campaign names"

# Debug tests in VS Code
# Add breakpoint and run "Jest: Debug"
```

## CI/CD Integration

Tests can be integrated into your CI pipeline:

```yaml
# Example GitHub Actions workflow
name: Tests
on: [push, pull_request]
jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v2
      - run: npm ci
      - run: npm run test:ci
```

## Coverage Goals

|------|------------------|------|
| Wizard Store | ~90% | 95% |
| Campaign List | ~85% | 90% |
| Wizard Client | ~80% | 85% |
| Integration | ~70% | 80% |

## Maintenance

- **Update tests** when adding new features
- **Run tests before** committing code
- **Review failing tests** immediately - they indicate potential bugs
- **Keep tests simple** - Each test should verify one behavior
