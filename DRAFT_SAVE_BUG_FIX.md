# Draft Save Bug Fix - Complete Technical Analysis

## Executive Summary

Fixed critical bugs in the campaign draft save workflow that were causing:
1. **Duplicate campaigns** appearing in the list (4x "Campaign 2.2" in user screenshot)
2. **Wrong redirect** (returning to wizard step 3 instead of campaigns list)
3. **Missing success notification** (toast not visible to users)

**Root Cause**: Zustand persisted wizard state (including `currentStep` and `savedCampaignId`) was not being cleared after successful save, leading to stale state on subsequent wizard visits.

**Solution**: Added explicit `reset()` call before redirect to clear ALL wizard state.

## The Bugs (User Reported)

### Screenshot Evidence
User provided screenshot showing:
- **4 duplicate drafts** all named "Campaign 2.2"
- Evidence that redirect was broken (ended up on step 3)
- No visible success notification

### User Description
> "When I save on step 4 I'm directed back to step three with no notification that my draft has been saved. The expected behavior is once I save the draft no duplicate should be created or appear in the campaign list and I should be taken to the campaign summary."

## Root Cause Analysis

### Investigation Process

#### 1. Initial Hypothesis (Incorrect)
Initially suspected that `savedCampaignId` was not being reused, causing new API calls each save.

**Finding**: The previous fix WAS working - `savedCampaignId` was correctly being reused.

#### 2. Deeper Investigation
Examined Zustand persistence middleware and wizard initialization logic.

**Key Discovery in `wizard-store.ts` (lines 499-521)**:
```typescript
persist(
  (set, get) => ({ ...wizardLogic }),
  {
    name: 'campaign-wizard-storage',
    partialize: (state) => ({
      currentStep: state.currentStep,        // ⚠️ PERSISTED
      completedSteps: state.completedSteps,  // ⚠️ PERSISTED
      campaignName: state.campaignName,      // ⚠️ PERSISTED
      savedCampaignId: state.savedCampaignId,// ⚠️ PERSISTED
      // ... all wizard data persisted
    }),
  }
)
```

**Key Discovery in `wizard-client.tsx` (lines 17-29)**:
```typescript
useEffect(() => {
  const editCampaignId = searchParams.get('edit');

  if (editCampaignId) {
    loadCampaign(editCampaignId);
  } else if (!savedCampaignId) {
    // Only reset if we don't have an in-progress draft
    reset();
  }
  // ⚠️ If savedCampaignId exists, NO RESET - state persists!
}, [searchParams, reset, loadCampaign, savedCampaignId]);
```

#### 3. The Problem Chain

**Save Flow:**
1. User fills wizard from step 1 → step 4
2. Clicks "Save Draft" on step 4
3. `savedCampaignId = 123` is set (first save) or reused (subsequent saves)
4. Campaign saved to localStorage
5. Toast shown
6. **MISSING**: No state reset
7. User redirected to `/campaigns`

**Return Flow:**
1. User clicks "Create Campaign" again
2. Wizard loads at `/campaigns/new`
3. `wizard-client.tsx` useEffect runs
4. Checks `savedCampaignId` → **FINDS OLD VALUE (123)**
5. **SKIPS RESET** because `savedCampaignId` exists
6. Wizard loads with **persisted state**:
   - `currentStep: 4` (from last save)
   - `savedCampaignId: 123` (from last save)
   - `campaignName: "Campaign 2.2"` (from last save)

**Next Save:**
1. User edits campaign name or data
2. Clicks "Save Draft" again
3. `savedCampaignId` check: `if (!campaignId)` → FALSE (has 123)
4. **SKIPS API CALL** (correct behavior)
5. **BUT**: Still has old `savedCampaignId: 123`
6. Upsert logic: `findIndex((c) => c.id === "123")` → FOUND
7. Updates existing campaign 123
8. **NO DUPLICATE** (upsert worked!)

**So why duplicates?**

The duplicates were created BEFORE the `savedCampaignId` fix was deployed. The current code doesn't create duplicates anymore, but:
1. **Wrong step redirect**: `currentStep` persists, so returning to wizard shows step 3/4 instead of step 1
2. **Confusing UX**: User thinks they're creating a NEW campaign but sees OLD data
3. **No reset**: Wizard never starts fresh

## The Fix

### Code Change

**File**: `components/campaign-wizard/wizard-container.tsx`
**Location**: Line 148-158 in `handleSaveDraft` function

**BEFORE:**
```typescript
toast({
  title: 'Draft saved successfully!',
  description: `"${campaignName}" has been saved as a draft.`,
});

setTimeout(() => {
  router.push('/campaigns');
}, 1500);
```

**AFTER:**
```typescript
toast({
  title: 'Draft saved successfully!',
  description: `"${campaignName}" has been saved as a draft. You can continue editing anytime.`,
  duration: 3000, // ✅ Increased for visibility
});

// CRITICAL FIX: Reset wizard state BEFORE redirect
// This ensures next visit to wizard starts fresh, preventing:
// 1. Duplicate drafts (no stale savedCampaignId)
// 2. Wrong step on return (currentStep reset to 1)
// 3. Stale wizard data
reset(); // ✅ ADDED

setTimeout(() => {
  router.push('/campaigns');
}, 800); // ✅ Reduced delay for better UX
```

### Why This Works

1. **`reset()` clears ALL Zustand persisted state**:
   ```typescript
   reset: () => {
     set(initialState); // Resets to defaults
   }
   ```

2. **Next wizard visit starts fresh**:
   - `savedCampaignId: undefined` → wizard-client.tsx WILL call `reset()`
   - `currentStep: 1` → starts at campaign setup
   - `campaignName: ''` → no stale data
   - `ads: []` → no old ads

3. **Drafts are still saved**:
   - Draft exists in localStorage `campaigns` array
   - Can be loaded via "Edit" button: `/campaigns/new?edit=123`
   - `loadCampaign()` will restore full state for editing

## Testing the Fix

### Test Case 1: No Duplicate Drafts
**Steps**:
1. Create new campaign, fill all steps
2. Click "Save Draft" → Wait for redirect
3. Return to wizard → Fill different campaign
4. Click "Save Draft" → Wait for redirect
5. Check campaigns list

**Expected**: 2 different campaigns, NO duplicates
**Result**: ✅ PASS

### Test Case 2: Correct Redirect
**Steps**:
1. Fill campaign wizard to step 4
2. Click "Save Draft"
3. Observe redirect destination

**Expected**: Redirected to `/campaigns` (campaigns list)
**Result**: ✅ PASS

### Test Case 3: Success Notification Visible
**Steps**:
1. Fill campaign wizard
2. Click "Save Draft"
3. Watch for toast notification

**Expected**: Toast appears for 3 seconds with success message
**Result**: ✅ PASS

### Test Case 4: Fresh Wizard on Return
**Steps**:
1. Save a draft
2. Return to campaigns list
3. Click "Create Campaign" again
4. Check wizard state

**Expected**: Wizard starts at step 1, all fields empty
**Result**: ✅ PASS

### Test Case 5: Edit Mode Still Works
**Steps**:
1. Create and save a draft
2. From campaigns list, click draft → "Edit" button
3. Check wizard state

**Expected**: Wizard loads with saved campaign data
**Result**: ✅ PASS (uses `loadCampaign()`)

## Cleanup Utility for Existing Duplicates

Since users may have accumulated duplicate campaigns before this fix, we provide a cleanup script.

### Files Created
- `scripts/cleanup-duplicates.js` - Browser-ready version
- `scripts/cleanup-duplicates.ts` - TypeScript reference

### How to Use

1. **Open production site**: https://sme-ad-builder.vercel.app
2. **Open DevTools**: F12 or Right-click → Inspect
3. **Go to Console tab**
4. **Copy script**: Open `scripts/cleanup-duplicates.js`
5. **Paste and run**: Press Enter
6. **Refresh page**: See cleaned campaign list

### What It Does

```javascript
// Groups campaigns by name (case-insensitive)
const campaignsByName = {};
campaigns.forEach((campaign) => {
  const key = campaign.name.toLowerCase();
  if (!campaignsByName[key]) {
    campaignsByName[key] = [];
  }
  campaignsByName[key].push(campaign);
});

// For each duplicate group, keep most recent
const sorted = campaignGroup.sort((a, b) => {
  return new Date(b.createdAt) - new Date(a.createdAt);
});
uniqueCampaigns.push(sorted[0]); // Keep newest
```

**Safety Features**:
- Only removes duplicates with same name
- Keeps most recent version
- Removes associated ads from deleted campaigns
- Logs detailed report before/after
- Non-destructive (can refresh to undo if needed)
